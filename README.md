## ✏️ How does it work?

You can add, edit and delete multiple memos.

You can add a new memo by pressing the "+" top-right button. All your memos are shown inside cute, minimalist boxes. You can edit a memo by clicking on it. You can also delete a memo to definitely erase it from this universe. 🌌  

Inside a memo you can put a title, a description, one or multiple images, some tags. 

This project is a wip.
